Hellbox
=======

Hellbox is a modular, editor-agnostic build system designed for font development. Hellbox is similar to some "Flow-based Programming" environments, consisting of a system of chained blackbox components.

**Hellbox is in the early stages of development. This document is more of a roadmap than documentation of the current implementation. Expect API changes without notice until v0.1.**

    :target: https://travis-ci.org/hellboxpy/hellbox

.. code-block:: python

    from hellbox import Hellbox
    from hellbox_generate_otf import GenerateOTF

    with Hellbox('build') as task:
        task.describe('Builds .otf files from .ufo source')
        task.read('*.ufo') >> GenerateOTF() >> task.write('./otf')

Installation
------------

First `install pip`_ (if not present), then run:

``pip install git+git://github.com/jackjennings/hellbox.git``

Goals
-----

* **Consistency** Hellbox tasks don't take arguments by design, favoring consistent task output
* **Modularity** Hellbox packages should be resuable and composable, while maintaining flexibility for custom workflows
* **Isolation** Hellbox tasks and packages are version locked and isolated from other Python installations

Overview
--------

Hellbox aims to provide both an environment and framework for defining build pipelines.

Hellbox tasks are composed of "chutes" â€” modules that perform a single operation over one or more files.

Chutes
------

There are two ways of defining a Hellbox chute, depending on the complexity and amount of configuration required.

The basic setup for defining your own chutes requires you to create a new subclass of ``Chute``. You must define a method ``run`` which accepts a single ``files`` argument (an array) and returns a new array of modified files. Besides ``run``, you can define any other methods you like on the new class.

.. code-block:: python

    from hellbox.chute import Chute

    class FilterFilesByExt(Chute):

        def __init__(self, *exts):
            self.exts = exts

        def run(self, files):
            return self._filter(files)

        def _filter(files):
            return [f for f in files if f.ext in self.exts]

You can then use your chute in your Hellfile as such:

.. code-block:: python

  with Hellbox('build') as task:
    task.read('*') >> FilterFilesByExt('ufo', 'txt') >> task.write('backup')

If your chute doesn't require arguments when initialized, you may prefer to define it with a function instead of a class. Using the ``@Chute.create`` function decorator makes a function definition act like a subclass of Chute:

.. code-block:: python

    from hellbox.chute import Chute

    @Chute.create
    def GenerateWOFF(files):
        # do something to files...
        return files

    with Hellbox('woff') as task:
        task.read('*.otf') >> GenerateWOFF() >> task.write('webfonts')

CLI
---

Hellbox comes with a command line tool `hell`_ which offers a thin layer over ``pipenv``. Using the CLI is highly recommended, as it makes working in isolation dead simple.

Development
-----------

Run tests with `make test`.
